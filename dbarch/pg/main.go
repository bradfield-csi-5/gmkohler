/**
 * Our goal will be to implement an iter-style query executor supporting a few basic queries
 * with selection (filtering rows), projection (filtering columns), and aggregation (such as COUNT
 * or SUM).
 *
 * At this point, we recommend using dummy data in memory, rather than attempting to read from a
 * database file on disk. Aim at least to implement a Scan node that yields a single record each
 * time its Next method is called, as well as a Selection node initialized with a predicate
 * function (one which returns true or false) which yields the next record for which the predicate
 * function returns true whenever its own next method is called.
